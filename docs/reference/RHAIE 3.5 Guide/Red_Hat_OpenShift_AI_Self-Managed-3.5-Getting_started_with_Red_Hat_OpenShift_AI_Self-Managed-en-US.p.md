### CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW

Red Hat OpenShift AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that provides tools to rapidly train, serve, and monitor machine learning (ML) models onsite, in the public cloud, or at the edge. 

OpenShift AI provides a powerful AI/ML platform for building AI-enabled applications. Data scientists and MLOps engineers can collaborate to move from experiment to production in a consistent environment quickly. 

You can deploy OpenShift AI on any supported version of OpenShift, whether on-premise, in the cloud, or in disconnected environments. For details on supported versions, see Supported Configurations for 3.x. 

1.1. DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW 

For the purpose of getting you started with OpenShift AI, the following figure illustrates a simplified data science workflow. The real world process of developing ML models is an iterative one. 

Figure 1.1. Simplified data science workflow 

The simplified data science workflow for predictive AI use cases includes the following tasks: 

Defining your business problem and setting goals to solve it. 

Gathering, cleaning, and preparing data. Data often has to be federated from a range of sources, and exploring and understanding data plays a key role in the success of a project. 

Evaluating and selecting ML models for your business use case. 

Train models for your business use case by tuning model parameters based on your set of training data. In practice, data scientists train a range of models, and compare performance while considering tradeoffs such as time and memory constraints. 

Integrate models into an application, including deployment and testing. After model training, the next step of the workflow is production. Data scientists are often responsible for putting the model in production and making it accessible so that a developer can integrate the model into an application. 

Monitor and manage deployed models. Depending on the organization, data scientists, data engineers, or ML engineers must monitor the performance of models in production, tracking prediction and performance metrics. 

Refine and retrain models. Data scientists can evaluate model performance results and refine models to improve outcome by excluding or including features, changing the training data, and modifying other configuration parameters.

### CHAPTER 3. CREATE A PROJECT

To implement a data science workflow, you must create a project. In OpenShift, a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the main way that you can manage user access to resources. A project organizes your data science work in one place and also allows you to collaborate with other developers and data scientists in your organization. 

Within a project, you can add the following functionality: 

Connections so that you can access data without having to hardcode information like endpoints or credentials. 

Workbenches for working with and processing data, and for developing models. 

Deployed models so that you can test them and then integrate them into intelligent applications. Deploying a model makes it available as a service that you can access by using an API. 

Pipelines for automating your ML workflow. 

Prerequisites 

You have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI. 

You have the appropriate roles and permissions to create projects. 

Procedure 

1. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, select Projects. The Projects page shows a list of projects that you can access. For each user-requested project in the list, the Name column shows the project display name, the user who requested the project, and the project description. 

2. Click Create project. 

3. In the Create project dialog, update the Name field to enter a unique display name for your project. 

4. Optional: If you want to change the default resource name for your project, click Edit resource name. The resource name is what your resource is labeled in OpenShift. Valid characters include lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-). The resource name cannot exceed 30 characters, and it must start with a letter and end with a letter or number. 

Note: You cannot change the resource name after the project is created. You can edit only the display name and the description. 

5. Optional: In the Description field, provide a project description. 

6. Click Create. 

Verification 

A project details page opens. From this page, you can add connections, create workbenches, configure pipelines, and deploy models. 

### CHAPTER 4. CREATE A WORKBENCH AND SELECT AN IDE

A workbench is an isolated area where you can examine and work with ML models. You can also work with data and run programs, for example to prepare and clean data. While a workbench is not required if, for example, you only want to service an existing model, one is needed for most data science workflow tasks, such as writing code to process data or training a model. 

When you create a workbench, you specify an image (an IDE, packages, and other dependencies). Supported IDEs include JupyterLab, code-server, and RStudio (Technology Preview). 

The IDEs are based on a server-client architecture. Each IDE provides a server that runs in a container on the OpenShift cluster, while the user interface (the client) is displayed in your web browser. For example, the Jupyter workbench runs in a container on the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The client is the JupyterLab interface that opens in your web browser on your local computer. All of the commands that you enter in JupyterLab are executed by the workbench. Similarly, other IDEs like code-server or RStudio Server provide a server that runs in a container on the OpenShift cluster, while the user interface is displayed in your web browser. This architecture allows you to interact through your local computer in a browser environment, while all processing occurs on the cluster. The cluster provides the benefits of larger available resources and security because the data being processed never leaves the cluster. 

In a workbench, you can also configure connections (to access external data for training models and to save models so that you can deploy them) and cluster storage (for persisting data). Workbenches within the same project can share models and data through object storage with the AI pipelines and model servers. 

For projects that require data retention, you can add container storage to the workbench you are creating. 

Within a project, you can create multiple workbenches. When to create a new workbench depends on considerations, such as the following: 

The workbench configuration (for example, CPU, RAM, or IDE). If you want to avoid editing the configuration of an existing workbench’s configuration to accommodate a new task, you can create a new workbench instead. 

Separation of tasks or activities. For example, you might want to use one workbench for your Large Language Models (LLM) experimentation activities, another workbench dedicated to a demo, and another workbench for testing. 

4.1. WORKBENCH IMAGES 

A workbench image is preinstalled with tools and libraries for model development. You can use the provided images, or an OpenShift AI administrator can create custom images tailored to your needs. 

Supported workbench images include the LLM compressor library for optimizing large language models *for inference. For more information, see Supported model compression workflows *. 

To provide a consistent, stable platform for your model development, many provided workbench images contain the same version of Python. Most workbench images available on OpenShift AI are pre-built and ready for you to use immediately after OpenShift AI is installed or upgraded. 

For information about Red Hat support of workbench images and packages, see Supported Configurations for 3.x. 

4.1.1. Administrator control over image visibility 

OpenShift AI includes two types of workbench images: 

Pre-installed images 

Workbench images that are shipped with Red Hat OpenShift AI and managed by the operator. Pre-installed images are displayed on the Workbench images admin page with a Pre-installed label badge. These images are read-only: you cannot edit or delete them, but you can control their visibility. 

Custom images 

Workbench images imported by administrators to address specific project requirements. Custom images can be imported, edited, enabled, disabled, or deleted. 

By default, all pre-installed images are enabled and visible to data scientists when they create workbenches. An administrator can disable individual pre-installed images from the Workbench images admin page. Disabled images do not appear in the image selection list when users create workbenches. 

Disabling an image does not affect workbenches that were previously created with that image. Those workbenches continue to display the image name and version in the workbench details and edit views. 

**Visibility settings are stored as the opendatahub.io/notebook-image-hidden annotation on ImageStream resources. This annotation persists across OpenShift AI operator upgrades because it is **applied by the administrator and is not included in the operator’s shipped manifests. 

A confirmation warning is displayed if you try to disable the last remaining enabled workbench image. Disabling all images prevents users from creating new workbenches until an image is re-enabled.

The hardware profile specifies the CPU and memory requests and limits for the container. 

a. Optional: To change the default values, click Customize resource requests and limits. 

6. Optional: In the Environment variables section, add environment variables to provide credentials or configuration values to the workbench. Setting environment variables during workbench configuration means you do not need to define them in the body of your notebooks or with the IDE command line interface. Environment variables set here are available in the workbench container when it starts. 

a. Click Add environment variable. 

b. From the Variable type list, select the type of environment variable to add: 

Select Secret to create a new Kubernetes Secret with key-value pairs entered directly or uploaded from a file. 

Select Config Map to create a new ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration values. 

Select Existing secret to reference a pre-existing Kubernetes Secret already present in the project namespace. Use this option for credentials managed outside OpenShift AI by your platform team or external tools. 

c. If you selected Secret, choose a data entry method: 

Select Key / value to enter key-value pairs manually. 

Select Upload to import key-value pairs from an environment file. 

d. If you selected Existing secret, complete the following steps: 

i. From the Secrets dropdown, search for and select one or more secrets by name. **Only Kubernetes Secrets of type Opaque that are not managed by the connections **framework appear in this dropdown. 

ii. For each selected secret, expand the secret entry to view its keys. Choose Select all to inject all keys, or select individual key checkboxes to inject specific keys. A badge displays the number of selected keys out of the total keys available. 

iii. Required: Review any environment variable name conflict warnings. If the same key name exists in multiple sources, such as across existing secrets and inline secrets, the form displays a warning that lists the conflicting key names and their sources. To resolve a conflict, clear the conflicting key from one source, remove a secret reference, or rename an inline key. 

NOTE 

Environment variables from existing secrets are set at workbench startup. If secret values change after the workbench starts, for example during a credential rotation, restart the workbench to pick up the new values. 

e. Optional: To add another environment variable, click Add environment variable and repeat the preceding steps. 

For more information about environment variable types and secret eligibility, see Environment variable types for workbenches . For detailed reference information about the existing secret interface, see Existing secret reference details for workbenches . 

7. In the Cluster storage section, configure the storage for your workbench. Select one of the following options:
